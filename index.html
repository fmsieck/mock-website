    <p class="bio">
        Lil Peep, was an American rapper and singer. He was cited as one of the primary artists responsible for the
        post-emo revival with his style of hip hop, which came to be known as emo trap. He was born on November 1, 1996
        in Allentown, Pennsylvania and grew up in Long Island, New York. His parents were both Harvard graduates who
        divorced when he was a teenager. His mother was a first grade teacher and his father was a college professor.
        Lil Peep attended Long Beach High School in Lido Beach, New York, which he rarely attended in spite of good
        grades. He later dropped out of the high school and took online courses to earn his diploma. Shortly thereafter,
        he began posting his music on YouTube and SoundCloud.

        When Lil Peep was 17, he moved to Los Angeles to pursue
        his career in music. He played the trombone and tuba and expressed an interest in music and fashion from a young
        age. Peep gathered a large cult fan-base and regularly sold out large venues. Peep's music, described as a
        fusion between hip hop and emo, helped introduce underground hip hop to styles that were more confessional. On
        November 15, 2017, Lil Peep was found dead on his tour bus when his manager went to check on him in preparation
        for that night's performance at a Tucson, Arizona venue.
